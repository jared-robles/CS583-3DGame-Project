# Mini Golf (working title)

Members: Jared Robles, Justin Cruz, Brandon Perillo, Justin Aguiluz

## Description of the Game

The game aims to simulate mini golf, featuring many courses with a low-poly style and simple mechanics that follow the rules of mini golf as closely as possible. As in mini golf, the player needs to get the ball to the end of the course and score a hole in as few strokes as possible and maintain a low score.

### Controls

- Left mouse button: Shoot the ball while aiming with the mouse cursor.
- Right mouse button: Move the camera around the ball while dragging.
- Scroll wheel: Move the camera towards and away from the ball.

### How to Play

Move the mouse cursor to aim where the ball will go and use the left mouse button to hit it. The ball is able to be hit when stationary and the number of hits are counted. The camera follows the ball and can be moved to get a better angle on where to hit the ball or to see the layout of the courses. The player passes the course when they get the ball in the hole.
